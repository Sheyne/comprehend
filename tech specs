====Technical=Specifications===================================================
first off, a language must define types.

These will not be hardcoded into the system as to allow multiple languages with
different types to also work.

For english, I'll define the basic type as:
	noun
	verb
	adjective
	adverb
	article
	ect...
	
To define a word list its types in parens followed by the name of the word,
	followed by a newline.
	
	ex.
		(noun) dog
		
	for more description of a word, it is posible to further attributes on an
	
	indented newline, ex:
		(noun) dog
			(noun) fur
			(adjective) speed
			(adjective) color = fur /*the `=' indicates that `dog' color is
									  linked to the `fur' color */
			
	This also defined fur as a noun and stated that it has a color attribute.
	eq. fur is now implied to be defined as
		(noun) fur
			(adjective) color
			
	if `cat was then defined as:
		(noun) cat
			(noun) fur
			(adjective) color, texture = fur
	
	`fur' would now be defined as:
		(noun) fur
			(adjective) color
			(adjective) texture /* note: color and texture could be defined on
								  one line as (adjective) color, texture */
	If suffix a definition with `!' we set it as a attribute search point.
		If for example we set a define a bear as:
			(noun) bear
				(noun) fur
		and set bear's texture to soft, an error is generated because bear does
			not have a texture attribute.
		but if we define bear as
			(noun) bear
				(noun) fur! /*not the exclamation point*/
		then set a bear's texture to soft, then, when it is discovered that
			bear has no texture attribute, it searches through search points 
			from the top down, and sees if they can take a texture attribute.
			since fur can the bears fur is set to soft, and no error is
			generated.
