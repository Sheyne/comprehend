----On the topic of sentence parsing------
------------------------------------------

To parse a sentence you must be able to
understand the meanings of all the words
in the sentence and how they fit together.

A parser must also have an environment in
which the conversation takes place. This
represents the place where two people are
talking.

----An example----------------------------
take the sentence:
>>>	There is a red dog.
	
We take this to mean two things:
1>	In the current environment there is a
	dog.
2>	The dog is red.

Lets look at `1' first:
	What a parser should do is create an
	instance of a noun (OOP Object) and 
	place it in the current environment.
	
Next in `2':
	Look in the current environment look
	for instances of the type dog, if there
	is only one:
		take it's highest ranking attribute
		that can take an instance of color
		(red) and set this to red.
