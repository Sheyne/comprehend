----On the topic of sentence parsing--------
--------------------------------------------

To parse a sentence you must be able to
understand the meanings of all the words
in the sentence and how they fit together.

A parser must also have an environment in
which the conversation takes place. This
represents the place where two people are
talking.

----An example------------------------------
take the sentence:
0.1> There is a red dog.
	
We take this to mean two things:
1.1> In the current environment there is a
	dog.
1.2> The dog is red.

Lets look at `1.1' first:
	What a parser should do is create an
	instance of a noun (OOP Object) and 
	place it in the current environment.
	
Next in `1.2':
	Look in the current environment look
	for instances of the type dog, if there
	is only one:
		take it's highest ranking attribute
		that can take an instance of color
		(red) and set this to red.
	if there are multiple `dogs' ask "which
	dog is red?"
	
Following the previous example, lets look at
the sentence "The dog runs after a Frisbee."

And break it into:

2.1> In the current environment there is a
	Frisbee.
2.2> The dog runs after the aforementioned
	Frisbee.
	
	`2.2' breaks into
	2.2.1> The dog performs an instance of
	the action run.
	2.2.2> The destination of the
	aforementioned run is to the location of
	the aforementioned Frisbee.
	
	
	
3.1> a `noun'
	an instance of a noun is created.
	
3.2> the `noun'
	look for an instance of a noun.
	
Looking at `0.1' again:
0.1> There is a red dog.

Lets break it into entities.

4.1> There is [a red dog]

`a red dog': instantiates a dog. and sets
	color to red.

`There is': takes an instance of a noun and
	places it in the current environment.
