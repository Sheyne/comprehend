==In the pursuit of link-grammar.==

The link grammar project will significantly help the project.

Taking a parsed sentence and doing something useful with it is the new goal.


==actions.dictionary==
	human: pause, (talk & (walk, run, stand, climb))
	dog cat: (run, sleep) & flick tail.
	dog: bark

	'&' actions can be performed concurrently.
	
	The memory of previous actions can be useful in situations such as:
	
		The man was sorting papers. A loud sound came from the outside. The man

		Note the bracketed part.
													  
		The A.I. must be able to answer the question (it itself may often ask),

5	The dog wakes up and barks. (0x01 wakes up. 0x01 barks.)
6	There is a cat. 			(make: 0x03)
7	The cat falls asleep. 		(0x?? falls asleep)
8			(Which cat?)	       ^^
9			The first one. 		(0x02 (answer))
		
	In the case of sentences 1 and 2, sentence 2 asks 1, what is it. 1 responds:
		The dog I just made (0x01).
	
	In the case of 6 and 7, one of two things can happen when
