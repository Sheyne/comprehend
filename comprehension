==In the pursuit of link-grammar.==

The link grammar project will significantly help the project.

Taking a parsed sentence and doing something useful with it is the new goal.

given a dictionary file:

==actions.dictionary==
human: pause, (talk & (walk, run, stand, climb))
dog cat: (run, sleep) & flick tail.
dog: bark
cat: meow
car: drive, park, race, floor it

note:
',' actions stop the previous action, but keep a memory of it,
'&' actions can be performed concurrently.

The memory of previous actions can be useful in situations such as:

	The man was sorting papers. A loud sound came from the outside. The man
		paused and looked up. He then returned to [what he was doing].

	Note the bracketed part.
												  
	The A.I. must be able to answer the question (it itself may often ask),
		"what was he doing?"
