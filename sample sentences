What this implies to me is that if `what' is followed by a being verb,
	the sentence is an inquiry. This being verb can be prefixed by an
	adjective or adverb (any descriptive word).
	On the other hand if `what' is suffixed by a noun the sentence is
		a statement.

What adjective being-verb noun.
What adverb being-verb noun verb.
